<p><strong>Promote Gender Equity in the Public League</strong>
	The vast majority of media attention in the Public League goes to men’s sports, particularly those in the top teams. When we see thousands of young lady’s ignored by the media at large, we at The Pub see an opportunity to show-off some of the best of the Public League. The Pub strives to make sure women’s sports receive equal coverage to men’s, in addition to making sure women are a major part of The Pub’s leadership and staff.

Promote Athletes Beyond Division 1 Candidates
	While plenty of Philadelphia athletes dream of playing for a scholarship, the vast majority will play school sports for the love of the game. The Pub sees sports as another form of education. Young people learn teamwork, perseverance, hard work, struggle, loss, and adversity in an arena where it is OK to make a mistake. We see these games - and the teams who are undercovered because they are not teeming with Division 1 athletes - as equally deserving of coverage and support.

The Public League Should Be Run by the Public Schools
	The Pub endeavors to make sure the Public League and its management is run by and for the students. The current system relies too much on private enterprises (Philly.com’s “Rally” section), which have zero accountability to the student-athletes. Our goal is to be ad-free, minimizing commercialization.

The Public League can be a Learning Tool
	Many athletes attest to sports as a type of education. But running an online hub for the Public League can benefit athletes while providing valuable, real-world experience for students. The Pub endeavors to bring coding, management, social media, and customer service experience to the high school.
